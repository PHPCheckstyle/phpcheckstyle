Version 0.6
-----------

 This is the very first release of Spike PHPCheckstyle. It is an alpha release.

 * Known Issues
   
   1. Indentation: The tools checks only for existence of tabs in a line. It 
      does not check that every line follows the 4 space indentation rule.
   2. Issue with do/while loop: The tool generates wrong errors when a do/while 
      loop contains a while loop or another do/while loop.
   3. Global variable nameing: Global variable naming convention checks are 
      not implemented.
   4. Docblocks: The tool currently checks only for the existence of docblocks 
      but not for all the required elements within it.
   5. Issue: when a cpp comment (starting with //) is followed by "}" in the 
      next line, reports that the "}" should be on a new line (even though it 
      is on a new line).
   6. Expects the configuration file to be {install-dir}/config/pear.cfg.xml.
      Can not change it.
   7. Some of the tests are not configurable (that is, they are checked, but can not 
      disable them). They are: "spaceAfterControlStmt", "spaceAfterSemicolon", 
      "noSpaceAfterFuncCall" and "spaceAfterFuncNameDefn". (Refer documentation 
      for more details on configurations).
