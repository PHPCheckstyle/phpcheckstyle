The XML generated by PHPCheckstyle is compatible with the original [http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ Checkstyle] XML format.

The [https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Violations Violation plugin] of [http://jenkins-ci.org/ Jenkins] or [http://hudson-ci.org/ Hudson] is capable of reading this file and displaying and historising the results.

First you need to configure ANT to launch the check. 
See [UsingWithANT Using with ANT].

The script must generate a XML result file using the {{{ --format xml }}} flag.

Then, you configure Jenkins with the violation plugin to read the generated xml file.
